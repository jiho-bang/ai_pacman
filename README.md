# AI Pacman

## Description
- Implemented AI agents in the Pacman environment to solve search, logic, and multi-agent planning challenges
- Built classic search algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*, and heuristics) to navigate and collect dots, then extended to logical reasoning (localization, mapping, SLAM) using propositional logic and a SAT solver
- Designed adversarial and probabilistic agents (minimax, expectimax, alpha-beta pruning) with custom evaluation functions to handle ghosts
- Explored algorithmic planning, logical inference, and strategic decision-making
